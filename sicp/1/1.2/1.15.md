(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
(if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

a.  How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?
> 5 times (we will divide 12.15 by 3 until we get the value less than 0.1)

b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by
the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?
> It's a linear in both space and number of steps.
